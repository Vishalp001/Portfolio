        <p>
          As an aspiring web Developer, I'm learning full stack web development
          and server based applications. I take part in creating websites from
          frontend and backend.
          <br /> <br />
          As a Web developer I also analyze user needs to ensure the proper
          content, graphics and underlying structure are used to meet both the
          goals of the user and the websiteâ€™s owner
          <br /> <br />
          In my free time, I enjoy working on a couple of personal projects and
          writing about stuff I learn.
